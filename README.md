#  Week 1

These are the key learnings for this week:

 - You’ll get to know SAPUI5 – the responsive UI library that SAP uses to create apps with the award-winning SAP Fiori user experience. We’ll introduce you to the library and start with a simple “Hello World” example. Step by step, we’ll then add more features to our app and explain how it all comes together.
 - You’ll learn about the main development concepts of SAPUI5. We’ll add many layout and UI controls and introduce the Model View Controller (MVC) concept to our app.
 - We’ll structure our application project with the application descriptor and a component. And we’ll introduce essential features to create enterprise-grade apps such as data binding and internationalization.
